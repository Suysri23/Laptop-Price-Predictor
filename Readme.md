## **Approach and Methodologies**
The project employs both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for analysis and predictions. The following algorithms have been implemented:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

These algorithms were applied to the dataset to extract insights, compare performances, and determine the most suitable model for price prediction. Detailed analysis and visualization were performed in a Jupyter Notebook to ensure a robust evaluation process.
